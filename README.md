# MealMe-localDB
This version of MealMe includes a local DB to persist the favorite button


MealMe is a single-page application that uses HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

It also uses the public API TheMealDB, which can be found at: https://www.themealdb.com/

Clicking on "I'm feelin' hungry" without any search criteria will respond with a random meal. With search criteria, a recipe that matches will be returned. In the event there is no corresponding recipe, an error message will occur, instructing you to try again.
Favorites are persisted to a local database.

You can find a working version of this project without persisting favorites here: https://albercher.github.io/MealMe/
